## Objective

The objective of this project was to implement and configure role-based access control (RBAC) using OpenZiti. This involved defining identities, assigning roles, and enforcing policies to restrict access to specific services based on predefined security requirements. The goal was to ensure that users and devices could only interact with services they were authorized for, enhancing security and minimizing unauthorized access.

### Skills Learned

- Configuring and managing Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) policies
- Implementing role-based access control (RBAC) using OpenZiti
- Defining service policies for binding and dialing based on identity attributes
- Managing and monitoring identities in OpenZiti Admin Console
- Troubleshooting policy misconfigurations and access control issues

### Tools Used

- OpenZiti (for Zero Trust Network Access implementation)
- Ziti Admin Console (for managing identities, roles, and policies)
- Linux (AlmaLinux Server) (for hosting services and configuring ZTNA policies)
- Windows/macOS Clients (for testing access restrictions)
